                A woman called her company’s tech support desk, and the technician asked for her password. She replied,
                <q>Snow White Cinderella Snoopy Dopey Pinocchio Harry Potter Ariel 5.</q> The technician said, <q>That’s
                    a great long password.</q> The woman replied, “Thank you! I was told my password needs to have seven
                characters and one number.”

                Jokes aside, you should never give anyone your password. As hacking methods get more sophisticated,
                there are new rules for creating hard-to-crack passwords. <a

                It’s also essential to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts. If someone tries to hack
                your account, he won’t have access to the one-time code sent to your phone or email.<a

                        being targeted. The truth is, they’re sending a similar email to as many people as possible.

                            My laptop gets hot while I use it. Does this mean that the laptop is malfunctioning?

                    <p>
                        Pretty much every laptop owner has been through a too-toasty experience with a machine at some
                        point. When laptops are working hard and using a lot of processing power, they naturally heat
                        up. This is a normal part of a laptop’s operation, but there are ways to help your machine chill
                        out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your laptop is abnormally hot, the first thing to check is its vents. One of the most common
                        reasons for overheating is dust accumulation inside the laptop, clogging up the openings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The recommended cleaning method involves turning off and unplugging your laptop and then blowing
                        out the vents with a can of compressed air to dislodge any dust or pet fur. Check your laptop
                        carefully for all of its vent locations. They can usually be found along the sides and on the
                        bottom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some laptops, especially those used for gaming, can run hot and still be within normal operating
                        parameters. But that can make the machine too warm to hold on your lap comfortably.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Get a laptop cooling pad. These devices lift the laptop and use fans to dissipate the heat from
                        the bottom of the computer.<a
                            href="https://www.amazon.com/Laptop-Cooling-Pads-External-Fans/b/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&slotNum=0&imprToken=c4ba7b57-95e7-8feb-bcb&ie=UTF8&node=2243862011&linkCode=sl2&tag=komandocom-20&linkId=2b8557c7c15d20ca826fcbf32b4d80fe&language=en_US"

                    <p>
                        Some non-powered pads on the market use mesh or little feet to raise up the laptop and allow for
                        more airflow. As an alternative, you can try setting your laptop on a flat surface and raising
                        the back up at an angle using something you find around the house, like the edge of a book. The
                        idea is to leave some airspace beneath the laptop and let it vent out the extra heat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the same vein, be careful about the type of surfaces on which you have your laptop. A cushy
                        pillow on your lap could cover the vents and cause problems.

                            I value my privacy. Browsers have incognito mode or private modes. Do these modes really
                            hide what I do online?

                    <p>
                        Most browsers feature a private browsing mode that won’t save your history or other data. In
                        Chrome, this feature is known as Incognito Mode. There are a few things that it does and does
                        not conceal.

                    <p>
                        Incognito/Private Browsing stops your computer or device from saving the following items:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Your web browsing history
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cookies
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Website data
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Incognito/Private Browsing <b>does not</b> hide the following items:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Your IP address
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your browsing history from your ISP
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your identity from the websites you visit
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Think of private browsing as a way to automatically clear out browsing data at the end of a
                        session. Websites and entities still know who you are, but your computer has no recordings of
                        your activity. If you want more privacy protection, use a VPN.
                    </p>

                        There are plenty of great reasons why you’d want to use incognito or private browsing. <a
